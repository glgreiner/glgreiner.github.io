   I am currently a first year Ph.D student at the [University of Utah](https://www.utah.edu/), where I am advised by [Pratik Soni](https://users.cs.utah.edu/~psoni/). Previously, I received my B.S. in Computer Science (with an additional major in mathematics) in 2024 from [Trinity University](https://www.trinity.edu/).

   In terms of research, I am primarily interested in Cryptrography, but also enjoy topics such as Machine Learning. Currently, I am working on developing novel adaptor signature schemes that enable fair exchange on blockchains. I am also interested in developing cryptographic tools that enable safe machine learning.

   You can find my CV [here]({{ '/cv/' | relative_url }}), and a list of my publications [here]({{ '/publications/' | relative_url }}).

   Feel free to contact me at u1529022\[@\]umail.utah.edu.
